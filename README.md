## Features
  - This application features a fully functional Flash Card game. Users can select an answer and the application will tell them if it is correct or not.
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Future extensions would make an application for the game that would use CSS and HTML to bring the game to a web page.
## Set Up

## Challenges 
  -  In this project a major challenge for me was making an application only using the console/terminal. It was difficult at first to view the data I was trying to pass into the project. I was able to overcome this challenge by using console logs and strategic testing.
