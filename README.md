## Introduction
  - In this project, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order to make a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game. I focused on using the DOM to display the Data model. I focused on using semantic HTML, DRY javascript, and clean CSS in-order to make a fully functional application.
## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
  - This application features a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game. Users can select a spot on the board, and place their icon. If they get three in a row they are a winner! If they cannot get three in a row the game declares a draw and resets the board. The users wins are displayed under their respective icons.
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Future extensions would allow the user to pick their character, and token. Another possible extension would be adding a login page when the user first accesses the application.
